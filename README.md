Software Developer · Data/AI Enthusiast · Grad Student @ Sacred Heart University  
I build things that turn messy, real-world problems into clean, reliable systems.

## About me
I like taking ideas from initial concept to architecture, clean code, and measurable results.  
Right now I’m focused on practical AI and backend engineering—apps people can actually use.

- Currently: Tickaro (Flask + PostgreSQL + Analytics) and IBIS (end-to-end AI insights)
- Open to: internships and collaborations in data platforms, recommenders, and ML apps
- Reach me: sandhyayadavavula@gmail.com · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandhya-avula-86633a20a/)
- I value clear documentation, neat dashboards, and reproducible results.

## Featured projects

### Tickaro — Reminders, Notes & Expenses (Backend-led)
A Python/Flask REST API with JWT auth, CRUD for reminders/notes/expenses, CSV/Excel upload, and analytics.  
Migrated SQLite → PostgreSQL with indexing and backups; insights powered by Pandas and Matplotlib/Plotly.

### IBIS — Intelligent Business Insights System
Upload → Clean → Train → Predict → Visualize with role-based access, validation/versioning, dashboards, and alerting.  
Designed for reliability and auditability so results are easy to trust.

### Hybrid Utility-Based Personalized Recommender (Multi-Agent)
CBR Agent (historical case match) + Context-Aware Utility Agent + LLM Agent for real-time enrichment.  
Ablation tests showed clear lifts in top-k relevance on scenario datasets.

### AI Virtual Fashion Try-On (Cloud Final)
Segmentation → pose/fit → rendering; documented latency, accuracy, and cost trade-offs with a working demo.

### Scope-Based CNN for Review Classification
NLP preprocessing (tokenization, embeddings) with a CNN for sentiment and category classification.
